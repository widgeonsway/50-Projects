            Why is the Netherlands also called Holland?
        </h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
            The Netherlands consists of 12 provinces, but "Holland" refers specifically to two of them: North Holland and South Holland. These provinces were historically the most influential in trade, naval power, and culture, leading to the common use of "Holland" to refer to the whole country.

        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
            Much of the Netherlands is below sea level, and the country has a long history of water management. Canals were built to drain land for agriculture, control flooding, and facilitate trade and transportation.
